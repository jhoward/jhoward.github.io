**Warmup** <br>
Write a function that computes factorial with a `for` loop.  Show its operation in a simple program.


**Problem 1** <br>
Write a recursive function to compute factorial.  Place this function (with a different name) in the same program as before.  Demonstrate that is returns the same value as your warmup function.



**Problem 2** <br>
Write a recursive function to compute the Nth Fibbonacci number.  This will be similar to your factorial program.


**Problem 3** <br>
Returning to something like the the triangle problem from last week.  Write produce a pyramid with N rows.

For example - a 6 row pyramid would look like...

```
     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
 *********
***********
```
