1. Write a program to print the numbers 1 to 10 and their squares.  Try to match the output.
```
1	1
2	4
3	9
...
10 100
```

2. Add to this program output that tells if each number is odd or even.  Make it so the user can tell the program how many numbers to print.
```
1	1 odd
2	4 even
3	9 odd
...
10 100 even
```


3. Write a program to print the following triangle.
```

Hint: Don't use ten printf statements; use two nested loops instead.

4. Write a program to simulate rolling N dice with M sides.  Save the sum of the N dice to an array.  Output the histogram of the results.
