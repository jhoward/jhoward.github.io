**Program 1** <br>
Write a program that accepts 3 numbers from the user and prints the middle value.  If there is a tie between any two numbers is instead indicates that no middle value exists.


**Program 2** <br>
Build a N by M rectangle.  You don't have to accept user input, but N and M should be easy to modify.  For example a 7 by 5 rectangle looks like the example below.  Note the spaces on the horizontal rows.

```
* * * * * * *
*           *
*           *
*           *
* * * * * * *
```
