Here we review some of the major concepts covered in this class to date.  This is a grounding lecture to ensure all have sufficient competency to complete simple programs covering all course material.


## Reference

### Variable Types

Recall the standard common variable types used in C.  This is not an exhaustive list, but contains many of the most common datatypes used in C programming.

**char**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an integer type. <br>
**int**    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most natural size of integer for the machine. <br>
**float**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single-precision floating point value. <br>
**double** &nbsp;&nbsp;A double-precision floating point value. <br>
**void**   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Represents the absence of type. <br>


### Conditionals

```c
if(condition) {
  EXECUTE CODE
} else if(condition) {
  EXECUTE CODE
} else {
  EXECUTE CODE
}
```


### Loops

For loops and while loops are the two most common loop styles in C.  Recall for a loop - it begins at a value in the initialization section.  It is checked for looping conditions in control, and is the initialized variable is modified in update.

``` c
for (initialization; control; update) {
  //loop body
}
```

this is equivalent to

``` c
//initialization
while(control) {
  //loop body
  //update
}
```


###Arrays

`int balance[] = {1000, 2, 3, 7, 10};`

``` c
          :
Address:  :     Value at that address:
        |----|
  0x5100|1000|  first values in array
        |----|
  0x5104|   2|  second value of array
        |----|
  0x5108|   3|  third value of array
        |----|
  0x5112|   7|  fourth value of array
        |----|
  0x5116|  10|  fifth value of array
        |----|
          :
          :
```

``` c
balance[4] = 50;
```

``` c
          :
Address:  :     Value at that address:
        |----|
  0x5100|1000|  first values in array
        |----|
  0x5104|   2|  second value of array
        |----|
  0x5108|   3|  third value of array
        |----|
  0x5112|   7|  fourth value of array
        |----|
  0x5116|  50|  fifth value of array
        |----|
          :
          :
```
